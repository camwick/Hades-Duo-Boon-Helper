# Hades-Duo-Boon-Helper
A short little companion program for the video game Hades. Prints out to console a list of Duo Boons able to be found during the run.

Contains 3 files: 
- excel sheet for information
- boon.py is a class file
- main.py runs the script

While playing the game, the user can type the name of the dieties they run into during the run. The program will spit out list of duo boons that are possible to be located during the run. 

I'll probably be making a verion of this app in a GUI.
